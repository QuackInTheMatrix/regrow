Thanks to the <a href="https://wayland-book.com/">Wayland book</a>, <a href="https://bugaevc.gitbooks.io/writing-wayland-clients/content/">Writing wayland client</a> and <a href="https://wayland.app/protocols/">Wayland explorer</a> for being a great source of resources for getting started with the project and making it super easy to read through the wayland documentation.
Couldn't have done it without them.
